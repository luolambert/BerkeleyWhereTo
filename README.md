## 💡 Inspiration

As a freshman selecting courses, I often faced a dilemma: **"Is it safe to schedule these two classes back-to-back?"**

Even with the famous 10-minute "Berkeley Time," rushing from one end of campus to the other can be stressful. I created this project to help you **visualize and estimate commute times** between buildings.

But campus life isn't just about rushing to class. It's also about understanding the history and legends around us. That's why this project has evolved into **Berkeley Where To**:

- **Where To Go**: Your smart navigation assistant.
- **Where To Know**: Your guide to campus stories and secrets.
